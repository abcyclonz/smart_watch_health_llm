 large language model (Gemini Pro) that integrates personalized health monitoring. The system uses a structured JSON file to simulate smartwatch health data, including heart rate, blood pressure, SpOâ‚‚, ECG status, fall detection, and sleep score. This health data is dynamically read on every chat turn, allowing real-time updates without restarting the application. The chatbot analyzes the data and, if any vitals fall outside safe ranges, gently incorporates alerts and recommendations into its replies. Otherwise, it engages naturally like a friendly companion. This architecture enables a modular and extensible design, where real smartwatch APIs or UIs can be plugged in later to replace the simulated data file.
