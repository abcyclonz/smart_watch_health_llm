# 🩺 SmartWatch Health Monitor with Conversational LLM

A real-time health monitoring system that integrates smartwatch sensor data with a conversational large language model (LLM). The system continuously checks live health data against predefined thresholds and alerts the user conversationally when potential health risks are detected.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Real-time data monitoring**: Continuously collect health metrics (e.g., heart rate, SpO₂, activity level) from a smartwatch.  
🧠 **Conversational AI**: Use an LLM to communicate naturally with the user, explain alerts, and suggest actions.  
⚠️ **Dynamic alerts**: Detect when health data crosses critical thresholds and proactively notify the user.  
🛠️ **Configurable thresholds**: Easily adjust thresholds based on user profile or doctor's recommendation.

## 🛎️ How It Works

1. **Collect Data**  
   - Stream health data (e.g., via Bluetooth or smartwatch SDK/APIs).
2. **Analyze Data**  
   - Compare live metrics to thresholds (e.g., HR > 120 bpm).
3. **Trigger Alert**  
   - If a threshold is broken, the system triggers an alert.
4. **Conversational Interaction**  
   - The LLM explains what happened, reassures the user, and may suggest next steps.
